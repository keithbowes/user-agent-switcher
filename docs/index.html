      User Agent Switcher Overview
    </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>
      User Agent Switcher
    </h1>
    <p>
      The User Agent Switcher extension adds a menu and a toolbar button to switch the user agent of a browser. The extension is available for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Toolkit_API">Toolkit</a>-based <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko">Gecko</a> applications (see the <em><a href="#works-in">Works in</a></em> section for more details), and will run on any platform that this layout engine supports, including Windows, OS X, and Linux.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Downloading and installing
    </h2>
    <p>
      The extension can be installed from from the <a href="https://github.com/keithbowes//user-agent-switcher/releases/">releases page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latest source code can be downloaded as a <a href="https://github.com/keithbowes/user-agent-switcher/zipball/master">ZIP file</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/keithbowes/user-agent-switcher/zipball/master">tarball</a>, or directly from <a href="https://github.com/keithbowes/user-agent-switcher.git">Github</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The current version should work in any Toolkit-based application using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko/Versions">Gecko 2.0 or higher</a>. It's been successfully tested in:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/all/">Firefox</a> 52.3.0
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.palemoon.org/">Pale Moon</a> 27.0.3
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/">SeaMonkey</a> 2.48
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It should also work in Firefox 4.0 or higher, Palemoon 4.0 or higher, SeaMonkey 2.1 or higher, and in other applications using Toolkit and Gecko 2.0 or higher, but these haven't been tested.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/user-agent-switcher/versions/">Older versions</a> <a href="https://github.com/keithbowes/user-agent-switcher/blob/e8ddcbafcfc5caeac9c33bc787dd4328741df456/development/common_install.rdf">claim to support</a> older 1.x and 2.x versions of Firefox and older 1.x versions of Flock. For SeaMonkey, 2.0 or higher is needed for it to function in a meaningful way (older versions claim to work in SeaMonkey 1.x, but they don't).
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, I recommend you use a current version of a maintained application if possible, to avoid putting yourself at risk for exploits.

      Plans
    </h2>
    <p>
      Currently my planned releases are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <del>0.8: My first release, separating it from the original. Maybe it should be 0.7.4, as there are no major changes, but just some annoyances I've had have been fixed (persistent settings, the name of the menu item stays the same, fix for Netflix not working with the Tech Patterns list).</del>
        <ul>
          <li>0.8.x: These will be updates for XPCOM browsers that don't support WebExtensions, but the bulk of new development will go to the WebExtensions port.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>0.9: This comes in two flavors: the XPCOM and WebExtensions flavors. The XPCOM flavor is merely meant to be used to migrate to the WebExtensions flavor. (Planned to coincide with Firefox 56.)
      </li>
      <li>1.0: The WebExtensions version should be stable by this time. The XPCOM version will be discontinued. Updates of the XPCOM version will be done exclusively in the 0.8.x branch. (Planned to coincide with Firefox 57.)
      </li>
    </ul>
