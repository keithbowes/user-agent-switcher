User Agent Switcher
===================

The User Agent Switcher extension adds a menu and a toolbar button to switch the user agent of a browser.
The extension is available for Toolkit-based Gecko applications (see below), and will run on any platform that this layout engine supports including Windows, OS X and Linux.

The extension can be installed from [the extension's home page](http://chrispederick.com/work/user-agent-switcher/), from [the extension's AMO page](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/user-agent-switcher/), or from the [releases page](releases/).


Works in
--------

The current version should work in any Toolkit-based application using Gecko 1.9 or higher.  It's been successfully tested in:

* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/all/) 45.6.0
* [Nightingale](http://getnightingale.com/all-versions.php) 1.12.1
* [SeaMonkey](http://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/) 2.46

It should also work in [Flock](https://web.archive.org/web/20110325151017/http://www.flock.com/) 2.x, Firefox 3.0 or higher, Nightingale 1.8 or higher, SeaMonkey 2.0 or higher, versions 0.3 or higher of Nightingale's predecessor [Songbird](http://getsongbird.net/), and in other applications using Toolkit and Gecko 1.9 or higher, but these haven't been tested.

[Older versions](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/user-agent-switcher/versions/) [claim to support](blob/e8ddcbafcfc5caeac9c33bc787dd4328741df456/development/common_install.rdf) older 1.x and 2.x versions of Firefox and older 1.x versions of Flock.  For SeaMonkey, 2.0 or higher is needed for it to function in a meaningful way (older versions claim to work in SeaMonkey 1.x, but they don't). 

Of course, I recommend you use a current version of a maintained application if possible, to avoid putting yourself at risk for exploits.  Currently, such applications are Firefox and SeaMonkey.  Flock and Songbird have been discontinued and shouldn't be used.
